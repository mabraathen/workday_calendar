# Workday Calendar

A simple way to calculate where we would end up in time if we were to go back or forth x number of working days, from a certian given point in time.

Examples of operations have been included in workday_calendar.py, and some test are in place and can be executed with "python -m pytest" (although they can also be viewed through the CI function of github).

A UI is not implemented as it was outside the scope of the task, and therefore if it is to be implemented in the future error handling should be properly implemented to account for wrong or invalid user input.
